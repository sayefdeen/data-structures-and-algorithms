# Reverse an Array

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- Implement a data structure called linkedList.
- Include a method called insert that will insert a new node to to linkedList
- Include a method called includes that return true if the argument is in the linked list, or false it it wasn't
- Include a method called toString that will return a string of all the values in the linkedList

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Make sure that the head is null in the first implementation, if that make the head the first node, if not find the last one and make the new node there,

includes, this will check all nodes values in an if condition

toString, will get all values an concat them into one string

- Big O is O(n), since we are moving for for all the elements before inserting a new one
