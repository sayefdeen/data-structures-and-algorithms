# Challenge Summary

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.

## Challenge Description

You are given a Pseudocode for Insertion Sort Algorithm, you have to create a function that represent this code and sort an array.

## Approach & Efficiency

- First I converted the Pseudocode into JavaScript code.
- Second I begin to trace the code, iteration by iteration
